            <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="textspacePortfolio1">
            <strong>C++:</strong> I have developed my C++ skills through various school related projects in my introductory programming class, computer systems class and algorithms and data structures class.
            <div class="bufferspace"></div>
            <strong>Arduino:</strong> My Arduino skills have been developed through my personal projects. From making a small Bluetooth remote controlled RC car to a small device which tracks the time of day.
            <div class="bufferspace"></div>
            <strong>Python:</strong> My work with the TIElab has required me to learn python as well as common libraries such as numpy and open cv.
            <div class="bufferspace"></div>
            <strong>Verilog:</strong> My previous electrical engineering classes have given me a basic understanding of Verilog. With my microprocessor class this semester, I hope to become more familiar with this HDL.
            <div class="bufferspace"></div>
            <strong>ARMv8 Assembly:</strong> I learned the ARMv8 language though my computer architecture class.

            <h2>Areas of Interest</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="textspacePortfolio1">
            <strong>Robotics/Embeded systems:</strong> What captures my interest is the potential of efficiency robotics offers. Robots can be used anywhere from defense to medical prosthetics. The idea that something can be controlled to complete tasks more efficiently than a human fascinates me.
            <div class="bufferspace"></div>
            <strong>Software engineering:</strong> After taking my first programming class I was hooked on the subject. Going in depth in these subjects  will give me a better idea of how our modern software is made. Operating systems for example have always fascinated me.
            <div class="bufferspace"></div>
            <strong>VLSI:</strong> I had a blast learning about digital logic and computer architecture. When you have a computer sitting in front of you, you can't help but wonder how you go from simple circuits to something so complex and advanced.
