                            <p>I am Mihir Hingwe.  Iâ€™m currently a junior computer engineering student at <a href ="https://www.tamu.edu/">A&M University</a> with a minor in mathematics. I am hoping to specialize in Robotics/Embedded systems, VLSI or Software engineering.</p>
                            <div class="bufferspace"></div>
                            <p>I was raised in Houston most of my life. When I entered Texas A&M university, I was originally planning on becoming a chemical engineer. However, after taking a introductory python class and attending tech workshops created by the TAMU Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineer club I finally decided on majoring in computer engineering.</p>
                            <div class="bufferspace"></div>
                            I am currently researching under <a href="http://teilab-static.arch.tamu.edu/quek/">Dr. Francis Quek</a> at TEILabs in telepresence robotics. My project this past semester has been focused on gestural space. Last semester I developed an image overlaying program and hope to improve It this upcoming semester. This opportunity sparked my interest in robotics and inspired me to specialize in Robotics/embedded systems. In addition, this opportunity has improved my communication and teamwork skills as I have to work with other graduate students to brainstorm potential research topics, create experiments to test out hypotheses and write research papers.

                            <p>I am currently the social events officer at the <a href="https://ieee-tamu.org/">TAMU Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineer</a> club. It is my job to organize social events so that the members can get to know each other. Though it has been a challenge with the pandemic, I have organized numerous social events for members using virtual platforms such as discord.  My time with the club been a blast and I have met many of my close friends by participating in events.

                            <p>Last semester, I joined <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/academics/undergraduate/engrx/ingeniare-choir.html">Ingeniare</a>, a engineering student only choir, as a new tenor. I have hummed along to songs here and there, but I joined to improve my singing and also learn more about music. Though it has been a challenge, I have learned a lot about reading music through the online format. I hope to improve my voice this upcoming semester and become a better musician.</p>
