                I am Mihir Hingwe.  Iâ€™m currently a junior computer engineering student at A&M University with a minor in mathematics. I am hoping to specialize in Robotics/Embedded systems, VLSI or Software engineering.

                I was raised in Houston most of my life. When I entered Texas A&M university, I was originally planning on becoming a chemical engineer. However, after taking a introductory python class and attending tech workshops created by the TAMU Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineer club I finally decided on majoring in computer engineering.

                I am currently researching under Dr. Francis Quek at TIELabs in telepresence robotics. My project this past semester has been focused on gestural space. Last semester I developed a image overlaying program and hope to improve It this upcoming semester. This opportunity sparked my interest in robotics and inspired me to specialize in Robotics/embedded systems. In addition, this opportunity has improved my communication and teamwork skills as I have to work with other graduate students to brainstorm potential research topics, create experiments to test out hypothesis and write research papers.

                I am currently the social events officer at the TAMU Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineer club. It is my job to organize social events so that the members can get to know each other. Though it has been a challenge with the pandemic, I have organized numerous social events for members using virtual platforms such as discord.  My time with the club been a blast and I have met many of my close friends by participating in events.

                Last semester, I joined Ingeniare, a engineering student only choir, as a new tenor. I have hummed along to songs here and there, but I joined to improve my singing and also learn more about music. Though it has been a challenge, I have learned a lot about reading music through the online format. I hope to improve my voice this upcoming semester and become a better musician.
